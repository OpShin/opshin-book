# Introduction to Opshin

Opshin is a pythonic language for writing smart contracts on the [Cardano](https://cardano.org/) blockchain.
The goal of Opshin is to reduce the barrier of entry in Smart Contract development on Cardano.
Opshin is a strict subset of [Python](https://python.org/), this is means anyone who knows Python can get up to speed on Opshin pretty quickly.

## Sample Code

```python
# hello_world.py

def validator(_: None) -> None:
    print("Hello world!")
```

## Why opshin?

- 100% valid Python. Leverage the existing tool stack for Python, syntax highlighting, linting, debugging, unit-testing, property-based testing, verification
- Intuitive. Just like Python.
- Flexible. Imperative, functional, the way you want it.
- Efficient & Secure. Static type inference ensures strict typing and optimized code.
